## Overview

This example application demonstrates how one may use Stytch within a React application. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project uses Stytch's [React SDK](https://stytch.com/docs/sdks/javascript-sdk) which provides pre-built UI components, useful React hooks, and headless methods to securely interact with Stytch.

This application features Email Magic Links and Google OAuth authentication. You can use this application's source code as a learning resource, or use it as a jumping off point for your own project. We are excited to see what you build with Stytch!

## Set up

Follow the steps below to get this application fully functional and running using your own Stytch credentials.

### In the Stytch Dashboard

1. Create a [Stytch](https://stytch.com/) account. Once your account is set up a Project called "My first project" will be automatically created for you.

2. Within your new Project, navigate to [SDK configuration](https://stytch.com/dashboard/sdk-configuration), and make the following changes:

   - Click **Enable SDK**.
   - Under **Authorized environments** add the domain `http://localhost:3000`.

   - Within the **Email Magic Links** drawer, toggle on **Enable the LoginOrCreate Flow**.

   - Toggle on **OAuth**.

3. Navigate to [Redirect URLs](https://stytch.com/dashboard/redirect-urls), and add `http://localhost:3000` as the types **Login** and **Sign-up**.

4. Navigate to [OAuth](https://stytch.com/dashboard/oauth), and set up login for Google in the Test environment. Follow all the instructions provided in the Dashboard. If you are not interested in OAuth login you can skip this step. However, the _Continue with Google_ button in this application will not work.

5. Finally, navigate to [API Keys](https://stytch.com/dashboard/api-keys), and copy your `public_token`. You will need this value later on.

### On your machine

In your terminal clone the project and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stytchauth/stytch-react-example.git
cd stytch-react-example
npm i
```

Next, create `.env.local` file by running the command below and your `public_token`. Learn more about Create React App's support for [custom environment variables here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/).

```bash
echo "REACT_APP_STYTCH_PUBLIC_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" > .env.local
# For example, echo "REACT_APP_STYTCH_PUBLIC_TOKEN=public-token-test-123abcd-1234-1234-abcd-123123abcabc" > .env.local
```

## Running locally

After completing all the set up steps above the application can be run with the command:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

You'll be able to login with Email Magic Links or Google OAuth and see your Stytch User object, Stytch Session, and see how logging out works.

## Next steps

This example app showcases a small portion of what you can accomplish with Stytch. Here are a few ideas to explore:

1. Add additional login methods like [Passwords](https://stytch.com/docs/passwords#guides_getting-started-sdk).
2. Replace the prebuilt UI with your own using by using the SDK's [headless methods](https://stytch.com/docs/sdks/javascript-sdk).
3. Replace the Google OAuth button with the high converting [Google One Tap UI](https://stytch.com/docs/oauth#guides_google-sdk).
4. Secure your app further by building MFA authentication using methods like [WebAuthn](https://stytch.com/docs/sdks/javascript-sdk#webauthn).
5. Use [Stytch Sessions](https://stytch.com/docs/sessions) to secure your backend.
