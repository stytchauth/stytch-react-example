# Stytch.js with React and Express

Example app using the Stytch Javascript SDK, React, and Express

# Getting started

1. Make sure you have node installed: `brew install node`
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
1. Add your Stytch API credentials from the API keys tab in your Stytch dashboard. You'll need to update `STYTCH_PROJECT_ID` and `STYTCH_SECRET` in your `.env` file with your project ID and secret from the dashboard.
1. From the API keys tab, create a public token and use it for `STYTCH_PUBLIC_TOKEN` in `Login.js`.
1. Run the app: `npm start`
1. Open the app in your browser at `localhost:9000`

# Session management

This app sets a variable in React state for authenticating a user to illustrate the user experience for authenticating with Stytch - we don't recommend doing this! You should use a more secure session management solution, like [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session).
